          <p>
            Today's salon owners face an unprecedented challenge: <strong class="text-white">time and attention</strong>. 
            In an industry where people have shifted to the internet as their source of truth, and social proof 
            plays a crucial role in choosing a new salon, marketing has become more important than ever.
          </p>

          <p>
            Yet salon owners are often the busiest people in their business. Between serving clients, 
            running operations, answering phones, and managing staff, there's simply no time left for the 
            comprehensive marketing their business needs to thrive.

            We created Next in Chair to solve this exact problem: <strong class="text-white">comprehensive marketing 
            systems that are simple and work together</strong> to cover every aspect of a salon's marketing needs

              <strong class="text-orange-400">We solve the problem of time and attention.</strong> Salon owners don't have to 
              design and customize marketing materials with Next in Chair. Everything is already designed based on 
              what we know works from 15+ years in the industry. You simply provide your specific information 
              (business info, media files, campaign type) and we do the rest.
            </p>

            You have control over what you choose to market, but you can feel good knowing you don't have to 
            manage any of it. <strong class="text-white">Automated marketing is crucial for salon owners</strong> because 
            you don't have time to do it yourself, don't have enough money to hire someone to do it, and don't 
            have time to maintain or keep up with it.
